        <p>For a school project, we were tasked with creating an app for the brand "FACE Stockholm" that would bring more color into users' lives. One of the specific requirements of the assignment was to make use of the sensors on the users' phones. Our team decided to create a live wallpaper app with customizable backgrounds that would change based on the user's surroundings.</p>
        <p>Designing the app was done in Figma, and we chose to follow Google's material design principles. It was the first time for me using this design language, and I found it intuitive and enjoyable to use. By following the principles, we were able to create a user-friendly and visually pleasing interface for the app. The project was a great learning experience, both in terms of design and using technology in creative ways.</p>

        <p>We began by conducting thorough research to understand the users' preferences and the potential applications of phone sensors. This research formed the foundation of our decision to create a live wallpaper that would dynamically respond to the sensors in the phone.</p>
        <p>As we delved into the design phase, we were inspired by Google's Material Design principles, which offered a modern and cohesive visual language. We wanted our app to provide a seamless and immersive user experience, and incorporating Material Design elements was a natural choice.</p>
        <p>During the design process, we created numerous prototypes and explored various background designs. In the final iteration of the app, we implemented a tab-based navigation system. This approach allowed us to organize the app's features into three distinct sections: the sensor functionality, the theme customization, and the color options. By structuring the app in this way, we aimed to enhance usability and provide users with a clear and intuitive interface.</p>
        <p>Overall, our progress throughout the project enabled us to develop a unique app that capitalized on phone sensors, utilized Google's Material Design principles, and offered a user-friendly and visually pleasing experience through its tab-based interface.</p>

        <p>In our quest to develop an outstanding app, we utilized Figma to create a comprehensive prototype that accurately reflected our vision. This was our team's initial foray into Figma for prototyping, and we were pleasantly surprised by its extensive range of features and user-friendly interface. Figma allowed us to effortlessly design and iterate on various elements of the app, resulting in a highly refined and visually appealing prototype. The scenario-based user tests we conducted provided valuable insights into user behavior and preferences, enabling us to fine-tune the prototype based on real-world feedback.</p>
        <p>During the process, I was particularly captivated by the functionality of Figma, as it streamlined our design workflow and fostered effective collaboration among team members. The ease of creating interactive components, refining layouts, and implementing animations greatly enhanced the overall quality of our prototype. Since our initial experience with Figma, I have continued to utilize this powerful tool in my subsequent projects, appreciating its efficiency and versatility.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the project exposed us to the principles of Material Design, which resonated strongly with our team. We embraced its clean aesthetics, intuitive navigation, and consistent visual language to create a cohesive and delightful user experience. The adoption of Material Design not only elevated the quality of our app prototype but also inspired me to incorporate its principles in my future design endeavors. The emphasis on meaningful animations, responsive layouts, and thoughtful use of color has become an integral part of my design approach, resulting in more engaging and visually captivating projects.</p>
