          <p>The Finalist project aimed to address communication challenges within the company, The existing communication channels, particularly a Teams channel, lacked clarity and proper indexing of activities, leading to miscommunication and task tracking difficulties. The objective was to design and implement a user-friendly tool to facilitate clear communication, task sharing, and collaboration among stakeholders.</p>
          <p>The research encompassed various aspects to inform the design and development of the new tool. Target group analysis focused on Finalist employees. Interviews with employees provided valuable insights into their experiences and challenges. Empathy mapping helped understand the feelings, needs, and motivations of employees during their work processes. Additionally, the creation of personas offered a vivid portrayal of different employees within the unit, enhancing understanding of their preferences and behaviors.</p>
          <p>The final outcome of the project was a well-informed design and prototype for the new tool, tailored to the needs and preferences of Finalist employees. The deliverables included a research report outlining the findings and insights gathered from the analyses and interviews. Based on the research, a concept was developed for the new tool, incorporating essential features for effective task sharing and collaboration. Prototypes for the website were created to visualize the user interface and user experience, allowing stakeholders to provide feedback and iterate on the design.</p>

          <p>The project commenced with comprehensive research and interviews, culminating in the visualization of gathered data to extract valuable insights and connections. These insights were instrumental in formulating user needs, providing a solid foundation for the development of the new tool. Subsequently, I translated these user needs into conceptual designs, presenting various ideas to stakeholders and refining them based on their feedback to establish clear system requirements.</p>
          <p>Transitioning into the prototyping phase, I began with wireframes to outline the structure and functionality of the tool before progressing to visual prototypes. These prototypes underwent rigorous testing with Finalist employees, allowing for iterative improvements and validation of design decisions. Through an iterative process of refinement informed by user feedback, the prototype evolved into a polished and user-centric solution that effectively addressed the identified needs, marking the successful conclusion of the project.</p>

          <p>Upon completion, the prototype developed in Figma proved to be a resounding success, having undergone thorough validation by the users. The tool is called Watskeburt. It effectively fulfilled the objective of enhancing communication within the company, providing a streamlined platform for sharing insights and fostering collaboration. Throughout this endeavor, I acquired valuable skills in leveraging AI for data visualization, empowering me to derive actionable insights and refine the tool based on user feedback. This iterative approach not only strengthened the concept but also facilitated a robust solution tailored to the specific needs of Finalist. Overall, the project underscored the importance of user-centric design and iterative development processes in achieving tangible outcomes that meet stakeholders' requirements and enhance organizational efficiency.</p>
