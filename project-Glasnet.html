          <p>During my 20-week internship at Glasnet.nl, I was tasked with conducting research to improve the usability of their website and alleviate the pressure on their customer support team. As an internet provider specializing in new glass fiber projects and offering subscriptions, Glasnet.nl needed a website that was user-friendly and informative to attract and retain customers.</p>
          <p>To achieve this goal, I conducted extensive research to identify pain points and areas for improvement on the website. Based on the research findings, I came up with solutions. The new website was designed to be more intuitive and user-friendly, with improved navigation and functionality.</p>
          <p>Halfway through my internship at glasnet.nl, after completing my initial prototypes, I was given a new assignment to build a webpage that allowed users to set up their own modem. This was an exciting challenge, and I spent the remainder of my time working on designing and building the webpage using HTML and JavaScript. This project required me to use my skills and knowledge in both design and development to create a user-friendly interface that was easy to navigate, even for users with limited technical knowledge.</p>

        <div class="cases2-text">
        <p>To ensure a successful outcome for the glasnet.nl project, I began with extensive research. This included analyzing the target audience and competitors while also exploring the functionalities of the current website. With this information, I set up a scenario-based user test that covered all the important aspects of the website. I conducted multiple rounds of testing with different users to gain a thorough understanding of the website's pain points.</p>
        <p>Based on the data collected from the usability tests, my first goal was to improve the sign-up process. Using UX design patterns and feedback from users, I was able to create a more user-friendly and streamlined sign-up process that addressed the users' needs.</p>
        <p>Next, I moved on to designing wireframes and creating prototypes, which were then verified through further user testing. The aim was to create a more intuitive and user-focused website that would meet the needs of the users and alleviate the pressure on customer support.</p>
        <p>Overall, the process of improving the usability of glasnet.nl involved a data-driven approach to design, with an emphasis on user testing and feedback to inform the design decisions. Through this process, I was able to develop a website that is more user-friendly, efficient, and effective in meeting the needs of the target audience.</p>

        <div class="results-text">
        <p>After implementing the improvements to the sign-up process, the results of the user tests were very promising. Users found the new sign-up page a lot easier to navigate and they had a clearer overview of their data. By simplifying the choices for the users and filling in the most popular option, we were able to reduce the stress of making decisions, a phenomenon known as the "paradox of choice". The new sign-up page was designed as one form, rather than separate questions, which made it easier for users to fill out and provided a more seamless experience. Further user tests confirmed that the new page was a lot more user-friendly, which was the ultimate goal of the project. These results demonstrated that a user-centered approach to website design can greatly improve the user experience and satisfaction, ultimately leading to better engagement and conversions.</p>

      <h2>Extra</h2>

          <img src="images/Glasnet Nieuw modem (Custom).png" alt="Glasnet Nieuw Modem">
        </div>
        <div class="intro-text notcentered">
          <p>After I was done with the prototypes for the sign up page I got another assignment. I was tasked with creating a new page for users who wanted to install their own modem, I quickly got to work. Having already conducted research on Glasnet's competitors, I knew what kind of information the page needed to display. However, I still had to interview many people at Glasnet to gather the specific details and requirements for the page. With this information, I designed a page that fit within the style of Glasnet and allowed users to easily navigate and understand the installation process. Through multiple iterations and user testing, the final product includes an introduction and a grid of connections, each with their own set of specifications. To showcase the final product, the full page can be viewed with all its animations on <a href="https://glasnet.nl/eigenmodem.html" target="_blank">the website</a>. By providing this additional resource, the pressure on Glasnet's customer service was significantly relieved, and customers were able to more easily navigate the installation process on their own.</p>
          <p>Taking on the task of building a new webpage for Glasnet.nl allowed me to gain valuable programming experience and learn new skills. While I had some prior experience with HTML and Javascript, this was the first time I was going to be writing code that would be deployed on a live website. Throughout the process of designing and building the page, I was able to hone my programming skills and expand my knowledge.</p>
          <p>In fact, my newfound love for programming has inspired me to take on new challenges, such as building this very portfolio website. Without this assignment, I may not have realized my passion for programming or the potential it has to unlock new opportunities in my future.</p>
